# Eureka Platform ![Eureka Token Logo](public/eureka-hd.png)

Implementation of a blockchain-based rating-publishing system. The EUREKA
ecosystem is a scientific rating-publishing platform with the Ethereum
blockchain as main infrastructure. EUREKA exploits blockchain technology and
smart contracts to enable a more efficient and trustworthy publishing process by
introducing time stamping for discoveries, rewarding reviewers, editors and
referenced authors and decentralising publishing. The EUREKA Token (EKA) is a
utility token and is a ERC20 combined with ERC667 token, thus it will follow
token standards provided by the Ethereum protocol, meaning it can be sent and
received in transactions on the Ethereum ecosystem.
